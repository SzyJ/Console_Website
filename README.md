# Console_Website
Unique design idea for a website. This is my 'CV' website that can be found at www.szymonjackiewi.cz
All code relating to displaying the console style, and the command and keyboard reading code was written by me.

Includes:
  - University Coursework CSS tutorial webiste. (nothing special)
  - favicon designed by me
  - 2 JavaScript files for website logic
  - CSS File for styling the website to imitate a command line
  - Simple HTML file


Known issues and porblems:
  - Some characters (e.g. tab) have actions within the browser window. I am looking for a way to disable this behaviour.
  - Any information about forcing the virtual keyboard to open on mobile devices, would be useful!
