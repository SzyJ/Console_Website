## Known issues and problems
* Formatting does not scale well when displayed on mobile devices
* Any information about forcing the virtual keyboard to open on mobile devices, would be useful
* After a link is clicked, pressing enter to issue another command, opens the previous link again (until the used clicks anyware but a hyperlink)
