    <p class="text_column" id="tc1">There are three main ways of representing colour in CSS. The first one is simply stating a valid colour name, for example "red". While this method is easily readible and understandable for humans, it doenst give much control over the appearance of the colour. Another way to represent colour, is through providing a number betwen 255 and 0 (inclusive) for the amount of Red, Green and Blue the desired colour consists off. For example a vivid red would be <span class="code">rgb(255,0,0)</span>. While this is a little bit harder to understand for amatures, it provides a lot of control over the colour tone and temperature. In grayscale colours, R=G=B. The third and most common way of representing colour, is through the use of a Hexadecimal value (Hex). This consists of 6 or 3 hexadecimal digits (0 to 9 or A to F (inclucive)), which will then be used to represent the RGB value just like the last method. </p>
    <p class="text_column" id="tc2">&nbsp;An example of a green colour &nbsp;could be represented as <span class="code">#00FF00</span> which in this case is the same as <span class="code">#0F0</span>. In this method, the first two digits represent &nbsp;the Red in the colour, second two Green and last two Blue. If each pair of digits matches, this can be reduced to 3. <br>
      There are many different ways of using these colours in your designs of webpages. Simply specifying <span class="code">color: #0F0;</span> in CSS, will modify the colour of the text inside the selector that it is being applied to.<br>
Backgrounds can be changed in several different ways too. Simply using <span class="code">background: #0F0;</span> would set the background to be a static colour however that could also be done through <span class="code">background-color: #0F0;</span> to make it more clear.</p>
    <p class="text_column" id="tc3">There is one more type of background that is often applied to elements; that is an image background. This is commonly done through <span class="code">background-image: url(path_to_image_file/image.jpg);</span>. There are many ways in which this could be further modified. If the image is smaller than the element, you may want to make it repeat using: <span class="code">background-repeat:repeat;</span>. This could give a nice effect if the image is a pattern that is designed to tile (like for example a simple horisontal line pattern). If the image being used is larger than the element, it will by default be positioned in the top left corner of the element. this can be changed to be centered at all times with <span class="code">background-position:center;</span>.</p>
